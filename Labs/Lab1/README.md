# ETL vs ELT

## Overview
This project demonstrates the key differences between **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** using a dataset of electric vehicle registrations (`ev_registrations.csv`).  

## Approaches Covered  
1. **Data Lake Approach (ELT)**  
   - Loads raw data into a "lake" folder.  
   - Applies transformations and schema "on read."  

2. **Data Warehouse Approach (ETL)**  
   - Cleans and transforms data before loading it into a structured table.  
   - Enforces schema "on write."  

## Implementation
- The notebook provides step-by-step implementation for both ETL and ELT pipelines.  
- It highlights the advantages and trade-offs of each approach.
