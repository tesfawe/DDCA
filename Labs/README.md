# Data Engineering Lab Exercises

## Overview
This directory contains lab exercises related to **data engineering** concepts, including **ETL, ELT, Data Warehousing, Data Lakes, Delta Tables, and Medallion Architecture**. 

## Lab Contents
### 1. ETL vs. ELT
- Demonstrates the differences between **Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)** and **Extract-Load-Transform (ELT)**.
- Uses sample datasets to compare a **Data Warehouse (schema-on-write)** vs. a **Data Lake (schema-on-read)** approach.

### 2. Data Warehousing & Data Lakes with Spark & Hive
- Explores how to store, transform, and query data using **Apache Spark** and **Hive**.
- Implements **structured (warehouse)** and **flexible (lake)** data processing techniques.

### 3. Delta Tables & Medallion Architecture
- Implements **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** layers for structured data transformation.
- Uses **Delta Lake** to ensure data quality, scalability, and efficient query execution.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark** - Distributed data processing
- **Hive** - Data Warehousing
- **Delta Lake** - ACID-compliant storage
- **Python / PySpark** - Data manipulation and scripting
- **SQL** - Querying structured datasets
- **Visualization Tools** - Data insights representation
