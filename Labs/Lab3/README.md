# Delta Tables and Medallion Architecture

## Overview
This exercise focuses on implementing **Delta Tables** using the **Medallion Architecture** to manage data pipelines efficiently. The objective is to design a structured ETL process that ensures data reliability, quality, and scalability.

## Objectives  
- Implement the **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers** in the Medallion Architecture.  
- Apply **data transformations** and **analysis** to improve data quality.  
- Develop **visualizations** that effectively communicate insights.  
- Design a pipeline that can handle new files dynamically without requiring major modifications.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Apache Spark** (for distributed data processing)  
- **Delta Lake** (for ACID-compliant data storage)  
- **Medallion Architecture** (for structured data refinement)  
- **Visualization Tools** (such as Matplotlib, and Seaborn)
